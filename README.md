<!-- About the Project -->
## 🎯 About
Here we built an SPA as a prototype of an online Learning 
Management System (LMS) called WhiteBoard.
This project implemented the front end features from the student's view.
It allows students to browse their course content and submit a set of class
quizzes which will then be graded on the server.
